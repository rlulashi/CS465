Angular and Express HTML are both great tools to use for constructing a website, however, Angular is designed for building dynamic pages using a structured project setup with a focus on using reusable components and files that are responsible for their own changes while Express HTML where the front-end is mostly static and the server-side is more flexible in nature allowing for greater project structure. SPA provides much faster load times after loading a singular page initially, which leads to greater response times. SPA also allows the capacity for complex animations utilizing JavaScript and also has the availability for offline work. However, searches can be impacted due to the complexity of how JavaScript renders.

A NoSQL MongoDB was used because it is great for scaling as needs may change but also it's compatibility with JavaScript. 

JSON and JavaScript work hand in hand but mostly because JSON is a not a programing language, it is a way to store and transfer data, while JavaScript is a programing language. 

While SPA allows for greater response time, the initial loading may take a while due to loading of all the necessary files. To test to ensure the SPA is working properly, utilizing Postman can assist with GET, POST, and PUT requests to the API endpoints. Once each of these methods is working properly then some error tests are thrown to check for issues. I was having difficulty applying the POST methods at first because I did not realize that the information I want to ensure is there must be entered in first. Once I understood that, that helped me along with other testing later on.
